# Overview

This document will walk you through the following integration flow

- Creating a Enmasse message queue 
- Creating a connection and integration in fuse ignite linked to the Enmasse message queue
- Creating a http endpoint that can publish a message to the Enmasse queue 
- Creating a http endpoint that exposes a REST API using Launcher
- Creating a connection to REST API from fuse
- Creating an integration between all of these via Fuse Ignite



# Prerequisites 

The installation has already been performed on an OpenShift cluster as per the installation document https://github.com/integr8ly/installation/blob/master/README.md.


# Login and choose the evals namespace

At the login screen you will see two options:

- htpassword
- rh_sso

You should pick the rh_sso option. You should then login as the ```evals@example.com``` user and on the right hand side, you should see ```My Projects``` select the ```evals``` project.
You should also take the opportunity to login your oc CLI as this user. You can do this by clicking the user at the top right of the OpenShift console UI and selecting ```copy login command``` from the drop down. Open a terminal and paste the command in.

# Setting up a Enmasse queue in your namespace 

- From your namespace click the catalog button on the left hand nav
- Provision a Enmasse service from the catalog (choose EnMasse standard) name it eval and choose not to bind at this time.
- Once complete, in the Eval namespace you will find a EnMasse provisioned service.
- Now create a binding to this provisioned service checking each available option. This will create a secret in the format `enmasse-standard-xxxxx-credentials-yyyyy`
- Collapse the provisioned service and click on the dashboard link which will show on the right hand side of the EnMasse provisioned service. This link will bring you to the EnMasse dashboard. 
- When asked to login click the OpenShift button and login with the same user that provisioned the service. In an eval environment this will be ```evals@example.com```
- Create a new address in the EnMasse console named ```work-queue/requests``` choose the ```queue``` option and the pooled plan.
- Create a second address in the EnMasse console named ```work-queue/worker-updates``` choose the ```queue``` option and the Pooled Queue.

# Deploy the CRUD REST HTTP booster

This is the HTTP endpoint that will revieve the requests from the Fuse Ignite 
integreation we create and add new fruits to the inventory.


Load up the launcher application. This is at ```https://launcher-launcher.<ROUTER_SUFFIX> ``` 

- Click on launch your project
- Login when prompted using the ```evals@example.com``` user
- The create application form will show. Choose ```eval``` as the name (this equates to your namespace)
- When prompted to select target environment choose : ```Code Locally, Build and Deploy```
- Click the blue down arrows
- Under mission select ```Crud```
- Under runtime select ```Spring Boot```
- Click the down arrows
- Under ``` Authorize Git Provider``` you will need to authorize launcher to have access to your github account.
- Once authorised, under the repository input change the value to ```crud-app```
- Wait for the down arrows to change color to blue, then click them
- Click setup application.
- This will create a repo called crud-app in your github account and deploy the CRUD booster to the eval namespace.

You can try out this application by going to the eval namepsace and clicking on the route created for this new application.


# Deploy the Messaging booster

This is a webapp that connects to the EnMasse address space. It allows the user to add new fruit to the inventory of the CRUD app via the EnMasse and CRUD app Integration in Fuse.

Load up the launcher application. This is at ```https://launcher-launcher.<ROUTER_SUFFIX> ``` 

- Click on launch your project
- Choose ```eval``` as the application name again
- When prompted to select target environment choose : ```Code Locally, Build and Deploy```
- Click the blue down arrows
- Under mission select ```Messaging Work Queue```
- Under runtime select ```Node.js```
- Choose the ```integreatly``` option in the dropdown
- Click the down arrows
- Under the repository input change the value to ```messaging-frontend```
- Wait for the down arrows to change color to blue, then click them
- Click setup application.
- This will create a repo called messaging-frontend in your github account and deploy the Messaging booster to the eval namespace.

There a some credentials to set to allow the messaging frontend to connect to the EnMasse address space.
First, get the `username` and `password` values from the EnMasse binding secret.
It has a name in the format `enmasse-standard-xxxxx-credentials-yyyyy`

Edit the `messaging-service` configmap, setting the `MESSAGING_SERVICE_PASSWORD` & `MESSAGING_SERVICE_USER` to the values from the EnMasse binding secret.

```
oc edit cm messaging-service -n eval
```

Restart the booster services

```
oc rollout latest nodejs-messaging-work-queue-frontend -n eval
```

In the log of the application you should see something like:

```
frontend-nodejs-aad7: Connected to AMQP messaging service at messaging.enmasse-eval.svc:5672
```

# Setup Enmasse connection in Fuse Ignite

You will need the `username` and `password` credentials again for this section from the EnMasse binding secret (`enmasse-standard-xxxxx-credentials-yyyyy`)

- Open the Fuse Ignite console. You will find the route in the OpenShift Web Console overview screen for the `eval` project.
- Login in to the Fuse Ignite console using the evals@example.com user 
- Select `Connections` and `Create connection`
- Find the `AMQP Message Broker` connector and select it. 
- Fill in the Connection URI Field with the following  ```amqp://messaging.enmasse-eval.svc:5672?amqp.saslMechanisms=PLAIN```
- Fill in the username and password fields with the `username` and `password` values from the EnMasse binding secret.
- Choose `Disable` for the Check Certificates dropdown
- Click Validate 
- Click the `Next` button at the top right
- Add a connection name ```enmasse```
- Click the `Create` button at the top right

# Setup HTTP connection to the CRUD REST booster in Fuse Ignite

- Stay in the Fuse Ignite console for this section
- Select `Connections` and `Create connection`
- Find the `HTTP Connector` and select it. 
- Set the base URL as the url exposed from the CRUD REST booster application that we created earlier (You can get this using `oc get route spring-boot-rest-http-crud -n eval`)
- Click `Validate` to ensure Fuse Ignite can reach the endpoint
- Click `Next` 
- Give the connection a name (crud booster)
- Click `Create`

# Creating the integration

- Stay in the Fuse Ignite console for this section
- Click on `Integrations` and `Create Integration`
- Click on the Enmaase connection
- Click on the ```Subscribe for messages``` option
- Under Destination Name add ```work-queue/requests ```
- Choose `Queue` as the Destination Type
- Click `Next`
- Set the `Select Type` as ```JSON Schema``` 
- Add the following schema to the `Definition` field & click `Done`
```
{
	"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"type": {
			"type": "string"
		},
		"stock": {
			"type": "string"
		}
	}
}
```
- On the ```Choose a Finish Connection``` screen select the `crud booster` connection you created
- Choose ```Invoke URL``` 
- In the URL Path set the path to ```/api/fruits```
- In the method select ```POST``` and click next
- Again under `Select Type` set it to ```JSON Schema``` 
- Add the following schema to the `Definition` field & click `Done`
```
{
	"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"name": {
			"type": "string"
		},
		"stock": {
			"type": "string"
		}
	}
}
```

- Next click the small plus between the two connections on the left hand side then click ```Add a step```
- Click ```Data Mapper``` 
- Map the `stock` property in the Source to the `stock` property in the Target by dragging from one side to the other. If done correct, a blue line will link the Source & Target.
- Map `type` in the Source to `name` in the Target, again by dragging from one side to the other
- Click `Done` at the top right

## Add some Integration logging steps (optional)

To add some more visibility we can add some logging steps to our integration.

- On the left hand side inbetween the connections you will see small blue boxes with plus symbols. For each of these do the following:

- click the blue plus symbol
- click `Add a step`
- choose `Log`
- select ```Message Body```

Once done we should now have 3 steps (5 if you added logging) in our integration. Click `Publish` in the top right.

Name the integration ```steel thread```


# Setup CHE to enable editing of the booster

The Che Dashboard can be found at ```https://che-che.<ROUTER_SUFFIX>``` 

## Self Signed Certs setup

If using a self signed (non CA) certificate on the Che route, there are a few things that need to be done before a Workspace can be created and used.

* Import the cert into Che Server (this is done autmatically by the ansible installer)
* Create a custom Node.js stack with the self signed certificate included. This is required so that stack instances (workspaces) can make requests back to the Che server.
* Import the self signed certificate into your browser. This is required so that a websocket connection back to the Che Server can be established, which is required by many parts of the Che Browser IDE.

Docs for how to do items 2 & 3 are available at https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/openshift-config.html.

## Authorize Che against your Github Account

Go to Profile > Preferences > SSH > VCS, and click the Github icon.
This will trigger an OAuth flow in your browser and prompt you to login to Github and authorize Che.

# Customise the messaging booster (optional)

We can add some additional information to the message. To do this we will need to change some of the code in the messaging booster. 

- Login to the Che Dashboard. The url is in the format ```https://che-che.<ROUTER_SUFFIX>``` 
- Create a new workspace from the custom Node.js Stack (the stack that has the custom image with self-signed cert included)
- Once the workspace is launched, click the `Workspace` menu item and select `Import Project`
- Select `github` as the target
- Click the `Load Repos` button to load a list of all your Github repos
- Choose the new booster repo that was created by Launcher e.g. `messaging-frontend`
- In the project configuration screen select ```Node JS``` and click `Save`
- Open the file ```frontend/app.js``` and modify the `message` body to prepend some text to the `type` in the ```/api/send-request``` endpoint e.g.

```js
app.post("/api/send-request", (req, resp) => {
    let message = {
        // ...
        body: JSON.stringify({type: 'Dr. Evals ' + req.body.text, stock: req.body.stock})
    };

    // ...
});
```

- Save your changes.
- Open the `Git` menu and click `Commit...`.
- Type in a commit message into the message window e.g. 'Prepend body type`
- Select the `Push commited changes to` option and ensure it is pointing to ```origin/master``` then click `Commit`
- A new build of the app will trigger automatically in OpenShift. Wait for the build & redeploy to complete before moving on.

# Invoke the integration

- Open the front end messaging webapp URL i.e. `http://frontend-eval.<ROUTER_SUFFIX>`
- Enter a Fruit name and a stock amount, then click `Send Request`
- Back in the Fuse console, open the integration and open the activity tab
- Expand the log entry. You should see the different steps it went through while invoking the integration
- Next open the route to the CRUD rest app. You should see a new Fruit type has been added with a stock quantity.
